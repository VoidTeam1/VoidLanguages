# VoidLanguages

You can help us translate the addon to other languages by opening a pull request here, just go to the folder of the respective addon, and make a new file with the translation based of english.json.

A pull request will be opened if you try to add a new language. It will be reviewed, and if everything is OK, the change is merged into production.
The translation will be then downloaded by all servers after a restart.

If you want to use your own translation without changing it here, you can just put it in garrysmod\data\voidlanguages\voidfactions.
Make sure it is not named as any other existing translation, or it will get overwritten.
